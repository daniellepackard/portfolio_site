		<div class="bio">
			<p>I am a sophomore year Frontend Web Development &amp; Design student at The Art Institute of Portland. I love what I do. I live, eat, drink, sleep, dream, read about, constantly think about and work on...design and development! It's my passion, my soul, my love. My life blood.</p>

			<p>I'm not one to wait for information. I like to seek out answers and solutions, whatever that may entail. It's an enjoyable part of learning for me.</p>

			<p>I am a reader. I devour books, magazines, blogs, and random information here and there. Of the seven or so professional industry magazine subscriptions I subscribe to I would say my two most favorite are <span>Communication Arts</span> and <span>Dwell</span>. I love the clean, crisp photography and layout of <span>Communication Arts</span>, and the absolutely gorgeous homes and buildings that I find in <span>Dwell</span> inspire me. I love architecture and seeing what people can do with indoor and outdoor spaces. Light and how it interacts within a space and outdoors has always been intriguing to me. <span>Dwell</span> magazine also shows homes and buildings from all around the world, which I love. I am an adventurer and keen observer at heart.</p>

			<p>In my off time I stay grounded, or in the flow as it were, with whitewater kayaking and alpine skiing. Time outdoors is a life balancer and brings in new ideas, fresh perspectives and new energy to then bring to my work and life.</p>
