		<h1>First Website from a Comp</h1>
		<h2>Frontend Web Development</h2>
		<h3>Web Design Fundamentals Class Project</h3>
		<p>Click to image to see and navigate the full site (it will open in a new window). The purpose of this project was to create the interior website pages only, from a comp. We were to do as close to or exactly as was on the comp to the best of our ability, but responsive design was not a part of the project (this was before we had covered responsive design). All links except link to Home are operational.</p>
