		<h1>Final Project Website</h1>
		<h2>Web Design &amp; Frontend Web Development</h2>
		<h3>Web Design Fundamentals Class Project</h3>
		<p>Click to image to see and navigate the full site (it will open in a new window). The purpose of this project was to create a five page website working with the skills we had covered during the quarter to the fullest of our abilities. I chose to create a website for an imaginary luxury resort in the Congo with the large, full-screen images, clean approach, and feeling of quality and warmth being front and center.</p>

		<p>The sub-menus on some of the pages are not linked to other pages, but the main navigation is fully functional. Responsive design was not a focus, but is explored somewhat in this design.</p>
